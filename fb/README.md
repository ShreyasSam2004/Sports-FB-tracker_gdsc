Hi this is my sports tracker (to be quite frank Football tracker!!) task which was done as a part of wec club recruitment . i have used ReactJs for building this project . I have used RapidApi's Football-API for api (https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football/) to fetch api requests for this project . You will see in some parts of this project i would have used dummy data . This is because i have a daily limit for sending api requests which is upto 100 only that is why i would have used dummy data , i have commented the useeffect part if you want you can uncomment and try using it . I have used useEffect for Fixtures part(on clicking fixtures in navbar) . Currently Players feautre will not be working . I dont know why my code seems to be correct but the page is not getting rendered on clicking .  
Api key is 7aac980ff3msh93c81d21d90965cp1dee86jsnaac8ce58a3fb .
